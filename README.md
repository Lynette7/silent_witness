# Silent Witness

Silent Witness is a revolutionary Dapp built on the Cardano blockchain that provides a secure and anonymous platform for reporting crimes and protecting the identities of victims and witnesses. Our solution leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) to ensure confidentiality and anonymity, allowing users to report crimes without fear of reprisal.

Millions of people fear reporting corrupt activities, domestic violence, and female genital mutilation (FGM) due to the risk of retaliation and danger to their lives.

Victims of these crimes often face significant barriers in reporting, such as the lack of anonymity, inadequate follow-up by authorities, and economic dependence on perpetrators.

Silent Witness preserves the identity of victims and witnesses by hiding their identities under a ZKP pseudonym. Users can log in and report crimes or submit evidence with their details remaining anonymous. Users will be witnesses.
